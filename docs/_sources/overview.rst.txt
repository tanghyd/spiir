Examples of Sphinx-generated documentation
------------------------------------------


It is hard to tell what has been made with Sphinx without looking at the
codebase source, but often if you scroll to the bottom of some
documentation you can often see a "Created using Sphinx <sphinx version>"
note in the footer. A small number of examples are referenced below.

* A large but absolutely not comprehensive listing collected by the Sphinx
  team: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html
* Sphinx's own documentation (made with Sphinx, of course!):
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
* Python 3 documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
* Python 2 documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/
* Tornado documentation: https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/
* Official RST documentation (note it is also made in Sphinx):
  https://docutils.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/user/rst/quickstart.html
* Dask documentation: https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/
* JupyterHub documentation: https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* NumPy documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/
* A small (slightly old) listing of non-Python projects with Sphinx
  documentation:
  https://ericholscher.com/blog/2014/feb/11/sphinx-isnt-just-for-python/
* An example of a book made with Sphinx: https://www.theoretical-physics.net/


Sphinx
------

Basic
^^^^^


* Sphinx documentation homepage: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
* Quick start including `sphinx-quickstart` command:
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html
* HTML themes: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/theming.html
  
Advanced
^^^^^^^^

* Guidance on extensions:
  https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html
* An "awesome" listing of extra Sphinx resources:
  https://github.com/yoloseem/awesome-sphinxdoc
* Big listing of even more HTML themes: https://sphinx-themes.org/
* Our customisation of the "alabaster" default theme, in practice:
  https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/
* Example Sphinx extension project repositories:

  * ``sphinx-copybutton`` (button to copy code in code examples):
    https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-copybutton 
  * ``sphinx-toggleprompt`` (button to hide prompts and outputs in
    console-like code examples):
    https://github.com/jurasofish/sphinx-toggleprompt
  * ``sphinx-pyreverse`` (generates UML diagramms of the code or parts of
    it into the documentation): https://github.com/alendit/sphinx-pyreverse


reStructuredText (`.rst` extension) format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Official reStructuredText documentation (note it is also made in Sphinx):

Documenting projects with Sphinx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A nice blog post: https://medium.com/@richdayandnight/a-simple-tutorial-on-how-to-document-your-python-project-using-sphinx-and-rinohtype-177c22a15b5b
* A great post showing how to use Sphinx with other tools to document a C++
